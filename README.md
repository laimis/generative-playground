## What's this?

This repository houses a web app that uses Google's MakerSuite APIs (Google Bard) and also OpenAPI APIs for interacting with generative text models. Right now only MakerSuite is added as I just got access, but OpenAPI should come shortly.

Very crude, single page to ask questions and get back generated responses.
